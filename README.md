# Thoughts for Shots

[![MIT Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://mit-license.org/)

## Description

Thoughts for Shots is our groups application created to satisfy our Project 3 requirements for our UW Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. This is a full stack, single page MERN application, which demonstrates our abilities to create an app with a React front end.

## User Story

```
AS A responsible adult of legal drinking age
I WANT an app that allows me to share a Thought about my day
SO THAT my friends can see it and donate Shots to me to celebrate or help me unwind.
```

## Demonstration

## Dependencies

For this application, we used the MERN stack (`Mongoose`, `Express.js`, `React.js`, and `Node.js`), alongside `Apollo-client`, `Apollo-server-express`, and `graphql`. Supplemental npm packages include `concurrently`, `moment`, `jsonwebtoken`, `jwt-decode`, and `bcrypt`.

## Troubleshooting

## Future Development

As a result of COVID, many restaurants started utilizing in-house mobile ordering and payment through the use of a QR code. We think there could be a way to incorporate this into our app, possibly by allowing users to upload the location of the bar or restauarant they are going to when they post a thought, so that their friends could possibly order them drinks or food directly through the restaurant/bar's site.

We also discussed the possibility of connecting our app with Venmo or Cashapp for drink donations, as these are widely used payment apps which would increase rapidity of payment from friend to thought-poster.
